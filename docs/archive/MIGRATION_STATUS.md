| Strategies    | hybrid_strategy_test.ps1 | strategy_test.go       | âœ… Complete | All strategies tested |
| Strategies    | hybrid_strat_verify.ps1  | strategy_verification_test.go | âœ… Complete | Verification tests implemented and fixed |
| Strategies    | direct_strategy_test.ps1 | direct_strategy_test.go | âœ… Complete | Added complete direct strategy testing |
| Strategies    | direct_strat_verify.ps1 | direct_verify_test.go | âœ… Complete | Added direct strategy verification tests |

## Test Coverage

**Current Go Test Coverage:** ~85% (estimated)
**Target Coverage:** 90%

## Implementation Status Update

Instead of implementing a new `internal/tools/core` package, we took a more direct approach:

- **Eliminated dependency**: Removed the need for the handlers package and context parameters
- **Simplified testing**: Modified scripts/testing/main.go to use direct Go command execution
- **Improved maintainability**: Reduced code complexity by removing unnecessary abstractions
- **Fixed middleware**: Implemented a simplified tool matching function directly in middleware.go
- **Removed unused imports**: Cleaned up commented-out imports in cmd/server/main.go
- **Maintained compatibility**: Updated legacy tests to work with the new approach

This approach resolves the "unused parameter: ctx" warning by removing the need for context parameters entirely and fixes all compilation errors without adding new packages.
