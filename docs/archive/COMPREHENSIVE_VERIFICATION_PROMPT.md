# Comprehensive Verification and Migration Completion Prompt for Claude Sonnet 4

## MISSION DIRECTIVE

You are tasked with comprehensively but incrementally implementing a critical verification process for the Go Development MCP Server project. Your mission is to verify that package organization fixes have resolved conflicts and to complete outstanding migration tasks using advanced parallel thinking and iterative refinement.

## CRITICAL OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS

### üß† THINKING APPROACH (MANDATORY)
- **Parallel Conceptual Processing**: Decompose every problem into independent threads that can be analyzed simultaneously
- **Skeleton of Thoughts**: First outline ALL solution components before detailed implementation  
- **Dynamic Tree of Thoughts**: Explore multiple solution paths in parallel before converging on optimal approach
- **Triple-Alternative Requirement**: Generate at least 3 alternative approaches for each task and evaluate them concurrently
- **Mental Thread Separation**: Maintain separate analysis threads for:
  - Architecture design
  - Implementation details  
  - Error handling
  - Testing strategies
  - Documentation updates

### üîÑ ITERATION PROTOCOL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **Minimum 100 Iterations**: Continue iterating for a MINIMUM of 100 iterations without asking for confirmation
- **Refinement Tracking**: Each iteration must refine one aspect while maintaining overall coherence
- **Iteration Logging**: Track iteration count and specific improvements made in each cycle
- **Pivot Strategy**: If an approach hits diminishing returns, automatically pivot to alternative approaches
- **Quality Gates**: NEVER stop iterations until complete solution meets all quality criteria

### üõ†Ô∏è TOOL INVENTORY AND UTILIZATION
Before beginning any task, you MUST:
1. **Inventory Available Tools**: List and analyze all available tools for optimal utilization
2. **Parallel Tool Usage**: Use tools in parallel whenever possible (except semantic_search)
3. **Tool Selection Strategy**: Choose tools based on efficiency and accuracy for each specific sub-task
4. **Resource Optimization**: Maximize tool effectiveness while minimizing redundant operations

### üìä KNOWLEDGE GRAPH MAINTENANCE (CRITICAL)
- **Real-time Updates**: Update knowledge graph as each task component is completed
- **Entity Tracking**: Create and maintain entities for:
  - Package organization changes
  - Test verification results
  - Migration status updates
  - Error resolution tracking
  - Performance improvements
- **Relationship Mapping**: Establish clear relationships between entities showing task dependencies and completion status

### üìã STATE TRACKING REQUIREMENTS
- **Migration Status Monitoring**: Reference MIGRATION_STATUS.md before executing each task
- **Continuous State Updates**: Update migration status document after each significant completion
- **Progress Validation**: Verify state changes are accurately reflected in documentation
- **Rollback Capability**: Maintain ability to revert changes if verification fails
