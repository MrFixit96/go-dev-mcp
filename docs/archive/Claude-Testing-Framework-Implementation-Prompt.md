# Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking Model: Go MCP Server Testing Framework Implementation

## Project Overview

You are working on a Go-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server project that is undergoing a comprehensive testing framework modernization. The project currently has a mix of PowerShell legacy tests and modern Go tests, with significant progress made in organizing the testing structure.

## Current State Assessment

Before beginning any work, you MUST:

1. **Read the Migration Status Document**:
   - File: `c:\Users\James\Documents\go-dev-mcp\scripts\testing\MIGRATION_STATUS.md`
   - This document tracks all completed work and outstanding tasks
   - Use this as your primary reference for current state

2. **Review the Organization Summary**:
   - File: `c:\Users\James\Documents\go-dev-mcp\scripts\testing\ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md`
   - This explains the current directory structure and organization

3. **Explore the Current Directory Structure**:
   - Use `d94_directory_tree` to examine `c:\Users\James\Documents\go-dev-mcp\scripts\testing`
   - Use `d94_list_directory` to understand the current file layout
   - Use `d94_read_file` to examine key files and understand the current implementations

## Primary Objectives

Based on the Migration Status document, implement the following next steps in order of priority:

### Phase 1: End-to-End Testing Infrastructure (High Priority)
**Objective**: Implement comprehensive E2E tests with mock server capability

#### Task 1.1: Mock Server Implementation
- **Location**: Create new files in `c:\Users\James\Documents\go-dev-mcp\internal\testing\mock\`
- **Requirements**:

  - JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol compliance for MCP
- **Files to Create**:
  - `mock_server.go` - Main mock server implementation
  - `mock_responses.go` - Predefined response templates

### Phase 3: Directory Structure Optimization (Medium Priority)
**Objective**: Complete the directory organization improvements

#### Task 3.1: Hybrid Strategy Directory Organization
- **Location**: `c:\Users\James\Documents\go-dev-mcp\scripts\testing\legacy\strategies\`
- **Requirements**:
  - Create `hybrid/` subdirectory matching the `direct/` structure
  - Move all hybrid-related tests to the new subdirectory
  - Update all references and script paths
  - Maintain backward compatibility
- **Files to Move/Update**:
  - Move `hybrid_strategy_test.ps1` to `hybrid/hybrid_strategy_test.ps1`
  - Move `hybrid_strat_verify.ps1` to `hybrid/hybrid_strat_verify.ps1`
  - Update `run_tests.ps1` references
  - Update `run_strategy_tests.ps1` references
- **Parallel Work**: Can be done independently

#### Task 3.2: Documentation Updates
- **Location**: Update documentation files
- **Requirements**:
  - Update `ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` to reflect hybrid directory changes
  - Update main project documentation
  - Create comprehensive testing guide
  - Document new testing patterns and best practices

  - Add new category to migration status table

## Implementation Guidelines

### Parallel Development Strategy
1. **Independent Workstreams**: Tasks 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, and 4.1 can be developed in parallel
2. **Dependent Tasks**: Tasks 1.2 depends on 1.1; Task 3.2 depends on 3.1
3. **Incremental Tasks**: Task 2.2 should be worked on continuously across phases

### File Management Approach
- **Use filesystem tools extensively**: `d94_read_file`, `d94_write_file`, `d94_create_directory`
- **Check current state before changes**: Always read files before modifying
- **Update migration status**: After completing each task, update the migration status document
- **Create before modifying**: Use `d94_create_file` for new files, `d94_edit_file` for modifications

### Progress Tracking Requirements
After completing each major task:

1. **Update Migration Status Table**: Mark completed items as ✅ Complete
2. **Update Progress Metrics**: Recalculate percentages and counts
3. **Add Recent Changes Entry**: Document what was accomplished
4. **Update Next Steps**: Remove completed items, add new discoveries
5. **Update Last Modified Date**: Keep the timestamp current

### Quality Standards
- **Go Code**: Follow Go best practices, proper error handling, comprehensive comments
- **PowerShell Scripts**: Follow PowerShell best practices, proper error handling
- **Tests**: Each test should be isolated, repeatable, and well-documented
- **Documentation**: Keep all documentation current and comprehensive

### Validation Requirements
For each completed task:
1. **Run existing tests**: Ensure no regressions
2. **Test new functionality**: Verify new features work as expected
3. **Update documentation**: Ensure docs reflect new state
4. **Cross-platform considerations**: Test on Windows environment specifically

## Starting Instructions

1. **Begin with State Assessment**: Read the migration status document and understand current state
2. **Choose Starting Point**: Pick the highest priority task that can be worked on independently
3. **Create Work Plan**: Break your chosen task into smaller subtasks
4. **Track Progress**: Update migration status as you make progress
5. **Test Continuously**: Run tests frequently to catch issues early

## Key Files to Monitor
- `c:\Users\James\Documents\go-dev-mcp\scripts\testing\MIGRATION_STATUS.md` - Primary tracking document
- `c:\Users\James\Documents\go-dev-mcp\scripts\testing\ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - Structure documentation
- `c:\Users\James\Documents\go-dev-mcp\scripts\testing\run_tests.ps1` - Main test runner
- All files in `c:\Users\James\Documents\go-dev-mcp\scripts\testing\legacy\` - Legacy test structure

## Success Criteria
- All items in "Next Steps" section are completed and marked as ✅
- Test coverage reaches 90% target
- All PowerShell tests are successfully migrated to Go
- Directory structure is fully organized and consistent
- Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date
- Mock server enables comprehensive E2E testing
- Metrics collection provides valuable insights into test performance

Remember: Work incrementally, test frequently, document thoroughly, and update the migration status document as you progress. Use the filesystem tools to maintain awareness of the current state and make changes systematically.
