# Test Framework Organization Summary

## Changes Completed

### 1. Directory Structure Organization
- Organized legacy PowerShell test scripts into proper subdirectories:
  - `legacy/basic/` - Contains simple tests
  - `legacy/core/` - Contains core functionality tests
  - `legacy/strategies/` - Contains strategy-specific tests
    - `legacy/strategies/hybrid/` - Hybrid strategy tests
    - `legacy/strategies/direct/` - Direct strategy tests (newly created)
  - `legacy/runners/` - Contains runner scripts previously in the root directory

### 2. Go Test Script Path Fixes
- Fixed `run_go_tests.ps1` to directly run `main.go` instead of searching for tests in non-existent locations
- Updated parameter handling for direct execution approach
- Confirmed script runs correctly with updated paths

### 3. Import Issues Resolution
- Fixed issues in `legacy/utils/main.go`:
  - Removed non-existent testutils import
  - Implemented `runLegacyDirectTest` and `runLegacyHybridTest` functions directly in the file
  - Fixed syntax errors and verified successful execution

### 4. Direct Command Execution Pattern
- Created new PowerShell test scripts for direct strategy testing:
  - `direct_strategy_test.ps1` - Primary direct strategy test
  - `direct_strat_verify.ps1` - Verification test for direct strategy
- Ensured all test scripts follow consistent patterns
- Verified that all Go test runners work successfully (main.go, direct_runner.go, hybrid_runner.go)

### 5. Test Runner Updates
- Updated `run_tests.ps1` to include the direct strategy tests in:
  - The "all" test type
  - The "strategies" test type

### 6. Runner Script Organization
- Moved all runner scripts to the `legacy/runners/` directory:
  - `run_go_tests.ps1` - Go test execution runner
  - `run_strategy_tests.ps1` - Strategy test execution runner
  - `run_tests_with_coverage.ps1` - Test coverage runner
- Updated the main `run_tests.ps1` to reference the relocated scripts
- Simplified directory structure with only `run_tests.ps1` in the root directory

## Testing Verification
All tests have been run using `.\run_tests.ps1 -TestType strategies -VerboseOutput` and completed successfully:
- Legacy direct strategy test
- Legacy direct strategy verification
- Legacy hybrid strategy test
- Legacy hybrid strategy verification

## File Structure
The current test framework structure is now:
```

```

## Latest Update (May 23, 2025)

- Moved e2e_test.go to dedicated e2e/ directory to resolve package conflicts
- Created proper package structure with dedicated subdirectories for specific test types
- Fixed package import conflicts between testing packages and main package
- Removed empty directories (basic/ and core/) as they're no longer needed
- Updated documentation to reflect the new organization

## Next Steps

- Add more comprehensive tests for both direct and hybrid strategies
- Continue to improve test coverage for edge cases in all strategy implementations
- Consider updating the wrapper scripts to include more verbose logging about delegating to legacy scripts
- Update the project's main documentation to reflect the new testing organization
- Consider creating a newer non-legacy testing framework that doesn't rely on PowerShell scripts
