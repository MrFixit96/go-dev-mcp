# Go Development MCP Server Testing Architecture

This document describes the testing architecture for the Go Development MCP Server, detailing the relationships between components, test types, and execution patterns.

    participant Strategy as Execution Strategy
    
    Runner->>Suite: Run test suite
    Suite->>Suite: SetupSuite()
    Suite->>Fixture: Create test project
    Fixture-->>Suite: Project created
    Suite->>Tool: Execute tool
    Tool->>Strategy: Select strategy
    Strategy->>Strategy: Execute with context
    Strategy-->>Tool: Return result
    Tool-->>Suite: Return result
    Suite->>Suite: Verify result
    Suite->>Suite: TearDownSuite()
    Suite->>Fixture: Cleanup
```

## Test Strategy

### Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation:

- **Input Parsing**: Testing the parsing of input parameters
- **Strategy Selection**: Testing the correct selection of execution strategies
- **Result Formatting**: Testing the formatting of results

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly:

- **Tool Execution**: Testing that tools execute correctly with different inputs
- **Error Handling**: Testing that errors are properly caught and reported
- **Timeouts**: Testing that execution timeouts work correctly

### Parallel Testing

The framework supports parallel test execution:

- **Test Isolation**: Each test operates in its own temporary directory
- **Resource Management**: Careful resource acquisition and cleanup
- **Concurrency Control**: Configurable parallelism levels

## Testing Patterns

### Table-Driven Testing

Table-driven tests allow testing multiple scenarios with the same test code:

```go
testCases := []struct {
    name     string
    input    string
    expected string
}{
    {"case1", "input1", "expected1"},
    {"case2", "input2", "expected2"},
    // ...more cases
}

for _, tc := range testCases {
    // Test logic here
}
```

### BDD-Style Testing

Some tests use a Given/When/Then structure for clarity:

- **Given**: Set up the test conditions
- **When**: Execute the operation being tested
- **Then**: Verify the results

## Test Coverage

The framework includes test coverage measurement:

- **Line Coverage**: Percentage of code lines executed by tests
- **Branch Coverage**: Percentage of code branches executed by tests
- **Function Coverage**: Percentage of functions called by tests

## Migration Strategy

The migration from PowerShell to Go tests follows this pattern:

1. **Parallel Development**: Maintain both test systems during transition
2. **Incremental Migration**: Replace PowerShell tests with Go tests in phases
3. **Feature Parity**: Ensure all functionality tested in PowerShell is covered in Go
4. **Validation**: Verify both test systems give consistent results
5. **Phase Out**: Once Go tests are comprehensive, phase out PowerShell tests

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Deterministic Tests**: Tests should produce the same results every time
2. **Fast Tests**: Tests should run quickly to encourage frequent testing
3. **Independent Tests**: Tests should not depend on each other
4. **Clear Expectations**: Tests should clearly indicate what they're testing
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests should cover normal and error cases
6. **Maintainable Tests**: Tests should be easy to understand and maintain
